    "Certainly! The geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues provides insight into how linear transformations affect vector spaces and how eigenvectors and eigenvalues characterize these transformations. Here's an explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvectors: Eigenvectors are special vectors that remain in the same direction (up to scaling) after a linear transformation is applied to them. Geometrically, an eigenvector represents a direction in the vector space that is invariant under the linear transformation. When a linear transformation is applied to an eigenvector, it may be scaled (stretched or compressed), but its direction remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues: Eigenvalues are scalar values associated with eigenvectors. They represent the factor by which the corresponding eigenvectors are scaled or stretched/compressed when the linear transformation is applied. Eigenvalues quantify how much the eigenvectors are stretched or shrunk along their respective directions.\n",

    "The geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be illustrated using a simple 2D transformation:\n",
