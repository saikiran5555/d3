    "To find the eigenvalues of a matrix, you need to solve the characteristic equation associated with the matrix. The characteristic equation is obtained by subtracting the identity matrix multiplied by a scalar λ from the original matrix and then taking the determinant. Here's the general process:\n",

    "Eigenvalues represent the scalar values by which the corresponding eigenvectors are scaled when a linear transformation (represented by the matrix) is applied to them. In other words, they quantify how much the eigenvectors are stretched or shrunk by the linear transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, eigenvalues determine the magnitude of stretching or compression along the corresponding eigenvectors' directions. They provide important insights into the behavior of linear transformations, such as how the transformation affects the shape, orientation, and scaling of vectors in the vector space.\n",

    "Eigenvalues are fundamental in various areas of mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. They are used in solving systems of linear differential equations, analyzing dynamical systems, computing principal components in dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, and much more.\n",
