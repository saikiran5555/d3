    "Eigenvectors are special vectors associated with linear transformations or matrices. They represent directions in the vector space that remain unchanged (up to scaling) when the linear transformation is applied. Eigenvectors play a fundamental role in linear algebra and have various applications in fields such as physics, engineering, and data analysis.\n",

    "The eigenvectors of a matrix can be used to diagonalize it, which is particularly useful in various applications, including solving systems of linear differential equations, analyzing stability in dynamical systems, and performing dimensionality reduction in data analysis (e.g., Principal Component Analysis)."
