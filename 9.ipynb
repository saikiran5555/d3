    "Yes, a matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, but each distinct set corresponds to a different linear transformation represented by the matrix. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Eigenvectors: A square matrix can have multiple linearly independent eigenvectors associated with the same eigenvalue. In other words, there can be different directions in the vector space that remain invariant under the linear transformation represented by the matrix, but they are all scaled by the same eigenvalue. These eigenvectors form a basis for the eigenspace corresponding to that eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Eigenvalues: Similarly, a matrix can have multiple distinct eigenvalues, each associated with its set of linearly independent eigenvectors. These eigenvalues represent different scaling factors by which the corresponding eigenvectors are stretched or compressed when the linear transformation is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated Eigenvalues: It's also possible for a matrix to have repeated eigenvalues, where one eigenvalue is associated with multiple linearly independent eigenvectors. In this case, the eigenspace corresponding to the repeated eigenvalue contains multiple linearly independent eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Degenerate Cases: In certain degenerate cases, a matrix may have fewer eigenvectors than its dimensionality or fewer distinct eigenvalues than its order. For example, a matrix with repeated eigenvalues may not have enough linearly independent eigenvectors to form a complete basis for the vector space."
